spring-data-rest-js
-------------------
This is just some experimental code that produces an AMD module that mirrors a repository created by Spring Data and exported as a REST service by Spring Data REST.

Note that at the moment, it's using older versions of Spring, Spring Data JPA, Spring Data REST, etc. That's because I started work on it using an existing Spring Data sample as the basis. Next steps are to upgrade to the latest versions (which will no doubt require some coding changes, as much has changed in Spring Data).
